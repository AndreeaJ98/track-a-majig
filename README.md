# Log-a-majig

The log-a-majig is a tracking app that intends to provide a easy way to track money spent or any other event.

Let's say you input the following lines in the app (similar to writing in a diary):
- 2022-03-03 05:20 spend 10 dolars on a cookie
- 2022-03-03 17:00 eat 100 calories
- 2022-03-03 17:00 spend 100 dolars on a new pair of jeans
- 2022-03-03 17:00 spend 1000 dolars on rent
- 2022-03-03 17:00 eat 400 calories
...

The Log-a-majig will parse all these individual logs and plot them in a nice graph.
Based on this graphs you can easily track:
- money spent this month
- calories eaten
- or other things depending on the log entries context
